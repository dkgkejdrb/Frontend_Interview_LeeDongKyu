## üìå Project Introduction

**NOTICE: This source code is my submission for a coding test as a application process. The code received a high score, allowing me to successfully pass the test due to its quality.**

This project provides functionality for administrators to set up schedules and infrom user of operationg hours.

Key features are:

1. Managing class periods by time slot
2. Configuring start and end times for classes
3. Offering a responsive UI for both tablet PCs and desktops

--------

### Coding Test Requirements (2024.08.10 ~ 11)

1. **Submission is completed within 2days.**

2. **Automatic Adjustment of Class Periods:** When adding or deleting a class period, subsequent periods should automatically adjust. For example, if there are three periods and the second period is deleted, the third period should shift to become the second period. Similarly, if a new period is added in the morning slot while periods exist in the afternoon slot, the existing afternoon periods should be renumbered accordingly.
3. **Limit on Class Periods per Time Slot:** Each time slot (morning, afternoon, evening) can manage a maximum of 5 periods. For example, if there are 5 periods in the morning slot and one period in the afternoon, deleting the 5th period should shift the afternoon period to the 5th slot in the morning.
4. **Confirmation Modal on Deletion:** A confirmation modal should appear when the delete button is clicked to verify the deletion action.
5. **Time Selection for Schedule:** Users should be able to select the time for each period. This includes selecting the hour (00-24) and minute (00-59) for each time block.
6. **Page Path:** The page should be accessible via the `/timetable` route.
7. **Responsive UI Design:** Although most users will access the application via tablet PCs, it should also be usable on desktops. The page width should be set to a maximum of 1024px and centered on the screen.
8. **Example of the UI screen that they asked me to submit**:

## üí° Enhancements 

### 1. Designing for API Connection

To dynamically display information from the ERP system via API, components were designed and developed accordingly. Before starting the project, I identified the necessary data to be dsiplayed on the screen and defined the corresponding data interfaces. Based on these interfaces, I set up dummy data for development.

Specifically, I decided to use a list data type for the feature of adding and deleting classes. This choice made it easier to develop key features and significantly reduced the time required for testing and debugging.

[Example of Data Strucutre for API Connection]

[Data Interface]

```json
// src/hooks/useTimeTableData.tsx
// key: class name, displayed on Tab. 
// value: each class consists of an array of up to 15 classes.
// The maximum length of the array is 15. Each element of the array represents a time slot for a day and includes both startTime and endTime.
{
    "2A-1 (201~)": [
        { "startTime": "08:00", "endTime": "08:50" },
        { "startTime": "09:00", "endTime": "10:15" },
        { "startTime": "10:30", "endTime": "12:00" },
        { "startTime": "", "endTime": "" }, // Empty space means no class
        { "startTime": "", "endTime": "" }
    ],
    ...
}
```





### 2. Optimazation for Table PC Screen

Since most users will be accessing this system on table PCs, the maximum screen width has been set to 600px. To accomodate this, the width of the components has been reduced, and their height has been optimized to display more components effectively.

### 3. Component Customization

To meet the requirements of this test, I searched extensively for a library that would allow users to select hours (00~24) and minute(00~59). However, no suitable lbrary was available, so I developed a custom TImePicker component.

During the development process, I encountered challenges in understanding how users would configure the time slots and how that data would be posted to the ERP system. To address this issue, I added on 'OK' button to the TImePicker component. When the user clicks this button, the data is updated and sent to the ERP system.

To close the TImePicker, the user must press the 'OK' button. This design choice ensures that users interact with the system correctly.

## ü§î Reflections...

while working at CREVERSE, I mainly used Javascript for service development. Because of this, I've been eager to learn and work with TypeScript to enhance my skills. Completing this coding test in a practical environment allowed me to do just that, and I enjoyed the experience of using TypeScript.

AS I worked through the task, I gained a deeper understanding of the test's purpose. The test maker isn't just looking for someone who can develop a front-end page. They want someone who can do so effectively, with careful consideration of the underlying data structure.

This experience is valuable in considering many thing to become a good forntend-developer.
