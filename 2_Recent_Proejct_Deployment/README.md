## Project Introduction

### **NOTICE**: This source code is not related to any CREVERSE assets, and all CREVERSE assets are excluded from this project.

This project provides making personalized chatbot via GUI tool and publishing landing page using Naver's HyperClova AI, specifically designed for primary and secondary students.

This project is served within the LCMS system's iframe, where it receives the Class ID and User ID from ERP system. These two key values are used for saving important data.

## User Scenario

**Step 1**: The user logs into the LCMS system and selects the GUI Tool for prompt engineering.

**Step 2**: Using the GUI Tool, the user performs prompt engineering to create a personalized chatbot model.

**Step 3**: The user sets up and publishes the landing page content through the landing page settings.

**Step 4**: A unique URL (/ClassID/UserID) is generated, allowing the user and others to view the published chatbot landing page.

## Reflections...

While working at CREVERSE, we needed to develop a system that would allow primary and secondary students to engage in prompt engineering and take home their practical results, due to an MOU with Naver Hyper Clova. As a developer, I not only led the development of the main front-end but also gathered various requirements from content creators for the GUI Tool and documented them. Based on these requirements, I created a storyboard and collaborated with designers to finalize the design concept. Additionally, I wrote the backend API documentation and communicated with backend developers to ensure the preparation of essential elements for the service.

Afterward, I proceeded with front-end development, conducting tests and refining the system in collaboration with content creators. During this process, I was able to address design revisions and backend errors, providing feedback and ensuring necessary corrections were made.

The system was deployed as part of a summer intensive course at two offline learning centers, and over 200 students used it. The system received positive feedback and was integrated not only into the special course but also into the regular curriculum. The source code for the system has since been handed over to my successor and is currently being further enhanced.
